1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    In server-side routing, the traditional approach, we navigate to  a web page, the website requests some data, and  the server returns a document to be rendered by the browser. In client-side routing, we manage the data for the application using JavaScript meaning that the browser has everything it needs to render content in its own memory. There are pros and cons to each e.g. in server-side routing, SEO is typically better at search engines have matured with this approach but it can take a while for pages to render, in client-side routing, smooth transitions between views are possible but the initial page may be loaded slower.
2.  What does HTTP stand for?
    HTTP is a protocol that defines how information is formatted and transferred. In browsers, this acts as a request-response protocol between the client and the server.
3.  What does CRUD stand for?
    CRUD is a set of operations - create, read, update, and delete.
4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    Create: post, Read: get, Update: put, Delete: delete.
5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
    Axios, Fetch API, and jQuery.
